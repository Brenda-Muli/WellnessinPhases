        <p className="mt-2">
          Menopause is a significant and natural phase in a woman's life, representing the end of her reproductive years. It is officially defined as the absence of menstrual periods for 12 consecutive months. This phase typically occurs between the ages of 45 and 55 and is a result of the gradual decline in ovarian function and a decrease in the production of key hormones such as estrogen and progesterone.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          As women approach menopause, they experience a variety of physiological changes. These include the cessation of menstruation and changes in reproductive hormone levels. While menopause itself is a normal biological process, the transition can be accompanied by various changes in the body. Understanding these changes helps in approaching this phase with confidence and preparing for a smooth transition.

        <p className="mt-2">
          Menopause signifies the conclusion of a womanâ€™s menstrual cycles, marking a significant shift in her reproductive life. The transition to menopause, often referred to as perimenopause, involves a gradual change in menstrual patterns as a result of fluctuating hormone levels. During this transitional phase, women may experience irregular menstrual cycles, which can include variations in the length and intensity of periods.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          The perimenopausal period can last several years before menstruation completely stops. It is characterized by fluctuating levels of estrogen and progesterone, the hormones responsible for regulating the menstrual cycle. As these hormone levels decrease, menstrual cycles become less predictable, with some women experiencing shorter or longer cycles, heavier or lighter bleeding, and occasional skipped periods. Eventually, menstruation ceases altogether, marking the official onset of menopause.
